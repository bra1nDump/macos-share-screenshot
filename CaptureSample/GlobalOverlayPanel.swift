// This class took me 2 days to get somewhat right - the flags are obviously very important.
//
// It accomplishes the following behavior:
// - From anywhere I will be able to use a keyboard shortcut to create a overlay over my entire screen
// - It will block interactions with existing applications while the user is selecting the range to screenshot
// - We will use this overly to draw the cursor and the selection rectangle (delegated to the
//
// The tricky parts:
// - We want the application not to take focus, so everything else on screen remains exacly the same
// - It allows to get keyboard events
//
// Most of this was eye balled and copied from pixel picker / Maccy projects
