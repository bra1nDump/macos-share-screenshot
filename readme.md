# Why?

Cmd+Shift+4, select area, save to desktop, drag from there to the app where you are trying to send the image. But you need to send 3 images, so you need to do this 3 times. Sound familiar?

CleanShot is a great product, but we think sharing / save / upload shortcuts can be further improved. Aaand it costs $30.

## Share Screenshot Features

- Free
- Keeps a stack of your recent screenshots
- Allows to share them in 2 clicks to any app, contact
- Allows drag and drop to any app

## How to install
We have submitted the app to the app store, but it is not yet approved. As of now you can only build it from source.

## How to use after installation
Press Cmd+Shift+7 to start selecting an area. The rest is intuitive!

This project implements extended screenshot functionality of native macOS screenshoting (try Shift+Cmd+4). We are trying to compete with clean shot X https://youtu.be/FZbICrBKWIU. To understand how hard it is to compete we are implementing a proof of concept with the main features from their product. I have already put together the basic infrastructure to implement the desired functionality.
