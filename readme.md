# Why Share Screenshot?

Cmd+Shift+4, select area, save to desktop, drag from there to the app where you are trying to send the image. But you need to send 3 images, so you need to do this 3 times. Sound familiar?

CleanShot is a great product, but we think sharing / save / upload shortcuts can be further improved. Aaand it costs $30.

## How to install

We have submitted the app to the app store, but it is not yet approved. As of now you can only build it from source.

## How to use after installation

- Run the app, press Cmd+Shift+7 to take a screenshot.
- First time you do this you will be asked to allow screen recording.
- Once you do, after re-launching the app you will be able to take a screenshot by pressing down and dragging, similar to Cmd+Shift+4 native screenshot tool.
- You can take multiple screenshots and they will stack on top of each other.
