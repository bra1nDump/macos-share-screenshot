# Clean Shot X
Demo: https://youtu.be/FZbICrBKWIU

# Ideas to differentiate
- Distribute on app store - distribution
- Price - cleanshot is 30$ - one time, no free tier
  - We can do free tier with up to 100 screenshots (this is what Awesome Screenshot does)
  - We can do .99$ / month for upload to cloud feature
    - 1GB of S3 storage is 0.023$ / month, so give up to 5GB of storage with basic plan
- Open source - so like Maccy - go after github clout instead of money. This being fully in SwiftUI could have a good reception and likely contributors.
- Allow you to configure upload to your own url for ... god knows for what
  - Custom domains is actually a nice feature from CleanShot - but thats more enterprisey - and they will always have more features, so we should not compete on that front
- As part of sending to other things - maybe we can have quick actions. For example I mostly send screnshots to Isaiah on Telegram. This is too custom though ... Maybe if integrated with shortcuts
- I was exploring a cute angle of customizing the screeshotting experience - like having a pacman like icon and animate the process of creating the screenshot.
- Target audience - ?? maybe developers .. as usual lol
